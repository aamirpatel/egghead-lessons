## Write a recursive function

### Lesson description
A recursive function - a function that calls itself - is a key tool in every functional programmer's toolbox. 
The body of a recursive function needs two main parts: 
- a recursive case, in which the recursive call is made, and 
- a base case, which does not involve recursion and prevents the function from recursing infinitely. 

In this lesson we'll learn the anatomy of a recursive function by writing a function 
to compute the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a positive integer.
